It was necessary to create a page with a list of users, the data I had to get from <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users">API</a> .
To begin with, I had to get data such as name, username, and email . I also added a photo of the user on my own behalf ðŸ˜„
The page needs a filter to search for the user in the form of a single text field. The search must be performed using the name, username, and email fields.
When working out the search in the list, you need to highlight the parts of the text that match the value in the filter.
You also need to add a Reset button that will reset the filter and restore deleted users. By clicking on a user in the list, it should
a modal window opens with the address and company of this user.
